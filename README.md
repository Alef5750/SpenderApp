# Welcome to Spender!

Spender is a mobile-first web application mock-up intended to help you manage your money expenses and become more conscious of your economical life.

I was fortunate to work on this with my first-ever coding teammates: Roi Livne, Jonathan TRABELSI, and Ram Smithson, in our final weeks of the awesome ITC bootcamp course.

My (me- Alef Lewitt) personal focus was the frontend portion, in-particular the various FORMS, as well as the EXPENSES pages.
